## GRC Case Study
*Real-world applications of security frameworks and privacy laws.*

### 1. [Enterprise Risk Register: NIST SP 800-30](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-1-Risk-Register)

* **Objective:** Identify and prioritize security risks for a mid-sized e-commerce entity following the NIST SP 800-30 framework.
* **GRC Focus:** Risk Identification, Likelihood/Impact Analysis, and Risk Treatment (Mitigate, Transfer, Accept, Avoid).
* **Outcome:** Developed an audit-ready Risk Register that reduced critical inherent risks (Score 9) to an acceptable residual level (Score 2) through recommended control implementations.

### 2. [Privacy-by-Design: Zero-Knowledge Age Verification](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-2-Privacy-By-Design)
* **Objective:** Achieve technical compliance with India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 and the EU GDPR.
* **GRC Focus:** Data Minimization, Privacy Engineering, and Risk Mitigation.
* **Outcome:** Developed a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that cryptographically verifies user age without the collection, transmission, or storage of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
  
### 3. [ISO 27001 Policy Framework](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-3-ISO-27001-Policies)
* **Objective:** Establish foundational security governance for a fintech startup.
* **GRC Focus:** ISMS Documentation, Access Control, and Incident Response.
* **Outcome:** Created a suite of 3 core policies aligned with ISO 27001:2022.

### 4. [DPDP Act 2023 Gap Analysis & Compliance Report](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-4-DPDP-Gap-Analysis)

* **Objective:** The primary objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive audit of **ShopLogic India** (a fictional e-commerce Data Fiduciary) against the mandates of India's **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023**. This analysis bridges the gap between legal requirements and technical implementation.
* **GRC Focus:**
  **Regulatory Mapping:** Translating specific legal sections (Sections 5-14) into actionable technical requirements.
  **Gap Identification:** Conducting a cross-functional audit of data collection, storage, and processing workflows.
* **Outcome:** The audit successfully identified several critical compliance gaps, most notably in **consent architecture** (Section 6) and **minor data processing** (Section 9). By identifying these vulnerabilities and providing a structured remediation roadmap, this project demonstrates how to mitigate significant legal and financial risks, including potential penalties of up to **₹250 Crore**.
