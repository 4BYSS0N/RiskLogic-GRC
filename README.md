## GRC Case Study
*Real-world applications of security frameworks and privacy laws.*

### 1. [Enterprise Risk Register: NIST SP 800-30](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-1-Risk-Register)

* **Objective:** Identify and prioritize security risks for a mid-sized e-commerce entity following the NIST SP 800-30 framework.
* **GRC Focus:** Risk Identification, Likelihood/Impact Analysis, and Risk Treatment (Mitigate, Transfer, Accept, Avoid).
* **Outcome:** Developed an audit-ready Risk Register that reduced critical inherent risks (Score 9) to an acceptable residual level (Score 2) through recommended control implementations.

### 4. [Privacy-by-Design: Zero-Knowledge Age Verification](https://github.com/RiskVectorX/RiskLogic-GRC/tree/Projects/Project-2-Privacy-By-Design)
* **Objective:** Achieve technical compliance with India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 and the EU GDPR.
* **GRC Focus:** Data Minimization, Privacy Engineering, and Risk Mitigation.
* **Outcome:** Developed a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that cryptographically verifies user age without the collection, transmission, or storage of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
