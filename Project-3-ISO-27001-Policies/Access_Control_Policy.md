## 1. Objective
The objective of this policy is to ensure that access to information and information processing facilities is restricted to authorized users. This framework is designed to prevent unauthorized access, mitigate the risk of data breaches, and ensure that access is granted based on legitimate business and security requirements.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
Users shall be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their assigned job functions. No user shall be granted broad or administrative access by default.

### 2.2 Need-to-Know
Access to specific data and systems is restricted to individuals who require that information to execute their specific professional tasks.

### 2.3 Segregation of Duties
To reduce the risk of fraud, error, or unauthorized activities, conflicting duties and areas of responsibility shall be segregated. No single individual shall have the power to initiate, authorize, and verify a transaction or system change in critical environments.

## 3. Access Lifecycle Management

### 3.1 Provisioning (Joiners)
Access rights are granted through a formal request and approval process. All requests must be documented via the HR and IT ticketing system and require explicit authorization from the relevant department head.

### 3.2 Modification (Movers)
Access rights must be reviewed and adjusted immediately when an employee changes roles, departments, or responsibilities. This ensures that permissions remain aligned with the current job function and that "privilege creep" is avoided.

### 3.3 Revocation (Leavers)
Upon the termination of employment or contract, all logical and physical access rights must be revoked within a maximum window of 4 hours to prevent unauthorized post-employment access.

## 4. User Responsibilities
* **Standard Conduct:** Users must not attempt to bypass security controls, exploit vulnerabilities, or gain unauthorized access to data outside of their assigned scope.
* **Privileged Accounts:** Administrative or "Privileged" accounts must be used exclusively for administrative tasks. These accounts must not be used for routine activities such as web browsing or email.
* **Credential Protection:** Users are responsible for the confidentiality of their authentication factors (passwords, tokens, or biometric data).

---

## 5. Review Cycle
To maintain compliance and security integrity, the following review schedule is mandated:
* **Sensitive Systems:** Access rights for critical systems (e.g., Production Databases, Financial Gateways) will be reviewed **quarterly** by Department Heads and the Security Team.
* **General Systems:** A comprehensive access review for all organizational systems will be conducted **annually**.
