# Project 3: ISO 27001 Policy Framework (Startup ISMS)

##  Business Context
**FinTech-Scale India** is a high-growth startup specializing in digital payment solutions. To secure institutional partnerships and prepare for **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** certification, the organization required a formal governance layer to manage its information security risks.

##  Project Objective
The goal of this project was to design and document a foundational **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**. This project demonstrates the ability to translate high-level security objectives into enforceable organizational policies—defining the "Law of the Land."

---

##  Methodology: ISO 27001 Mapping
The framework is built around three critical pillars of the **ISO 27001:2022** standard:



* **Governance (Annex A.5.1):** Establishing behavioral standards and management intent through the *Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)*.
* **Access Management (Annex A.5.15):** Implementing the *Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)* and *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* via the *Access Control Policy*.
* **Operations & Resilience (Annex A.5.24):** Creating a tactical *Incident Response Policy* to ensure structured handling and reporting of security events.

---

##  GRC Focus & Security Logic
* **Governance Layer:** These policies provide the administrative mandate required to implement technical controls. Without these "laws," technical security measures lack organizational authority.
* **Risk-Based Approach:** Each policy statement is designed to mitigate specific risks identified in the **Enterprise Risk Register (Project 1)**.
* **Enforceability:** Every document includes a clear "Enforcement" section, providing the necessary "teeth" for compliance accountability.

##  Regulatory Alignment
| Standard/Law | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | Directly mapped to Annex A controls regarding policy management, access, and incident handling. |
| **India DPDP Act 2023** | Supports the mandate for "reasonable security safeguards" by documenting governance and behavioral expectations. |
| **IT Act 2000** | Aligns with Indian cyber law requirements for maintaining "Due Diligence" in data handling. |
